        Hi, my name is Nick Zamerowski. I am a sophomore in the iSchool majoring in Information Management and Technology. 
        I have always liked playing around with tech, and I enjoy the hardware side of IT. 
        I am currently on the Deans List for the iSchool and have recently been selected for Eurotech Abroad. 
        While I do not have much experience with code, I am looking forward to learning it. 
        I am from Scranton, PA, which has a lot of outdoor activities nearby. 
        When I am back home, I take advantage of that and go hiking, swimming, and running with friends and family.
