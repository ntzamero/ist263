        <h1>Nick Zamerowski's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Nick Zamerowski. I am a sophomore in the iSchool majoring in Information Management and Technology. 
            I have always liked playing around with tech, and I enjoy the hardware side of IT. 
            I am currently on the Deans List for the iSchool and have recently been selected for <strong>Eurotech Abroad.</strong> 
            While I do not have much experience with code, I am looking forward to learning it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am from <strong>Scranton, PA.</strong> which has a lot of outdoor activities nearby. 
            When I am back home, I take advantage of that and go hiking, swimming, and running with friends and family. 
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Hiking is one of my favorite activities. Experimenting with cooking is another passion of mine, as it allows me to try new things. Additionally, I like watching Netflix and finding new shows to watch. 
        </p>
