            <h2>Speaker of the House</h2>
            <p>The United States House of Representatives only has one constitutionally mandated officer, which is the Speaker of the House. The Speaker acts as the presiding officer of the chamber and as the administrative head. They act as the de facto leader of the majority party of the House caucus and handle the scheduling and tabling of legislation. Contrary to popular belief, the Speaker does not have to be a member of Congress. However, every Speaker of the House has been a member of the House, so far. The Speaker is second in line of succession for the presidency, behind the Vice President. The current Speaker is Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana. He took office in 2024 after the previous Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, was removed from office. He has been a representative since 2017 and has served in several Republican leadership positions.</p>

    <h2>History of the House of Representatives</h2>
    <p>   
    The United States House of Representatives, often called the House, is one of the two chambers of the United States Congress, the other being the Senate. It's a big part of how America makes its laws. The House has been around since the very beginning of the United States. When the country was first starting out, in 1789, the House was created as a way for regular people to have a say in the government. Each state gets a certain number of representatives based on its population, so bigger states have more representatives than smaller ones. Over time, the number of representatives has grown as the country has grown. The House plays a key role in making laws, and its members, called "Representatives," are elected by the people to speak for them in Washington, D.C. It's a bit like a big group discussion where laws are debated, argued about, and voted on. The House has a long history of shaping America and making sure everyone's voice is heard.
