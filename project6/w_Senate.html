            <h3>President Pro Tempore</h3>
            <p>The second is the President Pro Tempore, who is the second highest ranking official in the Senate. The “pro tem” is officially required to act in the absence of the vice president, which is common during regular sessions. They are also third in line for succession of the presidency, behind the Vice President and Speaker of the House. The position is typically awarded to the most senior senator of the majority party. The current President Pro Tempore is Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington State. She assumed the position in 2023 after the retirement of longtime senator Patrick Leahy. She is the most senior member of the Senate Democratic Caucus, having been a member since 1993.</p>

            <h3>Senate Majority Leader</h3>
            <p>The most influential leadership position is the Senate Majority Leader. Their job is to schedule legislation for debate and communicate with their party on political agendas. They also control debate time assigned to each senator. Because of this, the majority leader can effectively kill any unwanted piece of legislation. The current Senate Majority Leader is Chuck Schumer, he is a Democrat from New York. He assumed the position in 2021 after Democrats regained a majority in the Senate and has been serving as a member since 1999.</p>

They are also responsible for ensuring the members vote in accordance with their party's position. Occasionally, the Whip is asked to stand in for the Majority Leader. The current Majority Whip is Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois. He assumed the position in 2021 after Democrats regained a majority in the Senate and has been serving as a member of the Senate since 1997.</p>

            <h3>Senate Minority Leader</h3>
            <p>When a political party is not in the majority, their leader becomes the Minority Leader. While they have the same responsibilities of communicating with their party and assigning legislative debate time, they do not enjoy all the powers the Majority Leader does. The minority leader does not have control over the bill scheduling process and cannot single-handedly stop legislation. The current Senate Minority Leader is Mitch McConnell. He was demoted from the Majority Leader after the 2020 elections. He is a Republican from Kentucky who has served in the Senate since 1987, and has held the spot of Majority leader from 2015 to 2021.</p>

            <h3>Senate Minority Whip</h3>
            <p>The Minority Whip performs nearly an identical role to the Majority Whip, as neither control the actual passage of legislation. This session's Minority Whip is John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota. He has been in the Senate since 2005, and has previously served as the Majority Whip from 2019-2021. He also served as a member for the U.S. House South Dakota district-at-large from 1997 to 2003.</p>
